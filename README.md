# TRFTR MOBILE APP

  The app is designed for the local second-hand clothing stores because they are too underground, and many people donâ€™t know their location. The main reason for that is because the owners are elder people and do not use the internet for promoting their store. The app encourages the people to go, personally to the stores and not to buy online. The app promotes anti-fast-fashion.
  

  It is a mobile designed in flutter, for android use.
  Its main purpose is to notify the users when a new drop of clothes arrives at their favourite local thrift-shops.
